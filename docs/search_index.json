[["index.html", "Thinking Like a Mountain Metadata Preface", " Thinking Like a Mountain Metadata Ira L. Parsons Preface This short book introduces the Thinking Like a Mountain Project and should aid in the workflow for any researchers who follow. This project was extremely fun, very challenging. It delves into topics of Animal Science, Rangeland Ecology, Movement Ecology, Metabolic Theory, Remote Sensing, and Data Science. It is my sincere hope that anyone using this data will approach this project as an opportunity to gain a deeper appreciation and respect for the culture of the unique people who have built their lives around caring for these natural resources while providing food to feed the rest of us. Ira Figure 0.1: Crossbred beef steers were fitted with tracking collars equipped with GPS location, Accelerometers, and at the Noble Research Insitute, front facing cameras. This created an unprecedented volume of data, requiring hundreds of pages of rscript to analyze. Here, I describe my naming system to keep track of analysis, series number to describe version, and the run order in a multiseries Rscripts. Output was named using the 3 numbers used to uniquely identify each Rscript. As always, future researchers should look at R script to see which data version the Rscript uses, and what the output is to find specific analysis pathways.

This project was conducted in collaboration with Mississippi State University, College of Forest Resources - Department of Wildlife Fisheries and Aquaculture, College of Agricultural Life Sciences - Department Animal and Dairy Science, and The Noble Research Institute. This project would have been impossible without a collaborative and diverse team of scientists who planned the project, and the dedicated team of graduate researchers, facility personnel, and undergraduate technicians who aided in the data acquisition and analysis. To enable future researchers to pick up the baton and quickly move forward with analysis, this document will describe the grazing landscapes, animals, and equipment used during the research project. It will also describe the data organizational structure, location of raw data, success of data acquisition including any gaps and reasons for data missingness, and provide a general timeline for each field season. Further, there will be a description of data format and code used for data analysis, the location of the materials, and what presentations and research manuscripts were derived from the data. Finally, a complete list of principle investigators, graduate student research assistants, facility personnel, and undergraduate research technicians will be provided along with their respective roles and contributions. The fundamental vision for the project is casts in the original narrative, which is available on the USDA NIFA website and in the Thinking Like a Mountain folder in the Raw data drive. As described in the project narrative, the first year of data was collected starting in January, 209, on the H.H. Leveck Animal Research Center, also the South Farm, at Mississippi State University in Starkville, MS. The second year of data collection occurred starting Janury, 2020 on the Pasture Development Facility at the the Noble Research Institute in Ardmore, Oklahoma. Figure 1.1: An overall outline of data collection at both research sites, as well as the overall timeline for both research technitions start and stop dates. Also included are dates of manuscript publications, national meeting presentations, and other important dates of note. 1.2 Primary files The data is organized on the TLM hard drive into the following primary folders, as seen in the figure below. - MSU_Grazingecology - Files from the Mississippi field season. - Noble_Grazingecology - Files from the Noble field season - Parsons PhD - Files from Ira Parsons, PhD work. - Software - Folder containing install files for a majority of the software files used throughout the project. - Thinking Like a Mountain - Folder with the initial grant narrative, references, and budget. - Link to Online Data Summary.txt - Link to this metadata website - Supplies list.docx - List of equipment and supplies, with associated links.

Follow the links to see the specific location on the South Farm, while the specific layout of the pasture for the trial period is described in Figure 2.2. ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile ## Source: &quot;/Volumes/Extreme SSD/MSU_Grazingecology/RawData/MSU_Pasture/WGS84_UTM16/MSU_Pasture.shp&quot;, layer: &quot;MSU_Pasture&quot; ## with 1 features ## It has 1 fields Figure 2.2: Layout of the Grazing Ecology Pasture on the South Farm for the trial conducted January 23rd, 2019 through December 15th, 2019. The project was conducted during the calendar year 2019. We see in the timeline (Figure 2.3), the general frequency of events, including the aquiring cattle on December 18th, 2018, initiation of sampling in early January, all prior to fitting collars on cattle and releasing them into the pasture on January 23rd, 2019. The trial concluded on December 15th, 2019, however, most data devices had failed by this point, specifically the Herdstrong rumen boluses and Lotek GPS tracking collars. A more detailed description of each data stream is listed in the subsections listed below. Figure 2.3: The timeline laid out below shows the general sequence of events, both planned and unplanned, for the timeline of the field season on the South Farm. 2.1 Bushnel Thirty-five Bushnel Essential game cameras were mounted at regular intervals around the perimeter of the pasture. Cameras were checked regularly to ensure they were functioning correctly, and a video was recorded to sync the camera time with UTC time using the time.is/GMT website. The technician first opened the camera door, shut the camera off, and turned it back on, which initiated the camera’s startup sequence. After start up, the technician then snapped their fingers on camera at a recorded UTC time, which are saved “Time Catalog.xlsx” which includes both the recorded time and date, along with the observed time and date. These are combined into the “Master_Time Catalog.csv” using the R code in “1 Cam time adj.R” script. Videos containing observed calibration sequences are saved in the “cal_times” folder. This was used to create a “Cam_timeadj.csv” file, which identifies the correct adjustment for each camera over the duration of the trial (Figure 2.4). It is noted that as time progressed, camera drift increased (Figure 2.4). Pictures were downloaded from the cameras at frequent intervals, as demonstrated in Figure 2.3, and placed into an individually labeled folder within ’*F:_Grazingecology’ location on the raw data drive. Folders were named according to camera number and download date, separated by an underscore and dated according to the yyyymmdd fashion. So, folder 1_20190204 are pictures from camera 1 and downloaded on 2019-02-04, or February 4th, 2019.

Herd records indicating birthdate, sire number and breed, cow number and breed, and birth weight, are available in the excel sheet ‘Copy of CattleBrandi.xlsx’, (Figure 2.6). Original scale sheets and notes from cattle processing are saved into the “Scale Sheets” folder, which are the raw scale sheets used to record data chuteside. Data was recorded into the spreadsheet “Cattle_records.xlsx”, with a separate sheet used for each weighing event, and then combined into the “DATA” sheet, which was read into the R space and saved to the “Cattle-wts.csv” file. All weights are recorded in pounds unless otherwise specified. Specific notes for each animal, regarding numbers, new tags, bolus assignments, individual animal management, are recorded in the raw data, individual date sheets, and the “Cattle” sheet. Cattle growth weights were tracked live in the “graphs” tab. In publication, cattle should be described as British crossbred steers. Figure 2.6: Data files collected on cattle used during the 2019 field season on the Mississippi State South Farm. Figure 2.7: Number of weights collected for the cattle project 2.3 Daily Diary Accelerometers Daily diaries (Figure 2.8) were deployed in the housing of the lotek collars above the battery pack in a holder cut from Kaizien foam. Data from each deployment is recorded in an individual metadata file for that animalxtime combo. Folders are labeled with the deployment date and animal number, i.e. 20190123_F029 was deployed on January 23rd, 2019 on animal F029. Deployment data are also saved in the master metadata file located The “text.txt: and ‘text2.txt’ files are saved Metadata folder *F:_Grazingecologyin the file “MSU_Collar_DDMT_Logs.xlsx” file. This folder includes the animal VID (visual identification number), color color, Accelerometer ID number, SD card ID number, Deployment name, Turnon date, Turnon time, Deployment date, Calibration date and time, retreival date in both current time and UTC time, final calibration sequence, turnoff time. Also included are data processing information from the DDMT software (*F:), such as Data end date and time for each text file, Geomag adjustments for each file, and the export location for splits. Here, any noted issues with the data are made in the Comments column. Calibration steps are reported in the sheet labeled ‘Calibration_steps’ in the data log excel file. Sheet1 includes basic information noting collar number, accelerometer number, and animal id which may be usefull to link data to individual animals.

Insert the SD card into the SD card slot on the accelerometer until a firm click is heard. Apply a small spot of hot glue to the back of the sd card to prevent falling out. Plugin the battery, recording the exact time, UTC time, the battery is plugged in. Look for two bright yellow flashes and then observe closely for a light green flash, indicating the accelerometer is recording data. Insert the accelerometer and the battery into the foam, place the foam into collar housing, and ensure it is waterproofed. In an open area, calibrate the collar, recording the exact second, UTC time, calibration begins. Holding the collar upright, oriented like it will be on the animal, push the collar directly out from your chest, then bring it abruptly back. Do this 5 times. Holding collar upright, push out from chest and hold to count of 10. Holding the collar upright, in front of your chest, move the collar side to side, first left, then right, five times. Holding the collar upright in front of your chest, move the collar swiftly up and down, down, then up, five times. Facing directly towards magnetic north, Rotate the collar end over end, pushing the top away from you, and begin to slowly spin in a circle, stopping in the original northerly direction. Facing the northerly direction with the collar directly in front of your chest, rotate the collar around the Z axis which extends from the bottom of the collar to the top of the collar towards the sky.

Figure 2.9: Data collection success using the Daily Diary Accelerometers 2.4 Forage and Pasture 2.4.1 Forage Forage samples were collected on a 20 meter grid on each forage sample locations (Figure 2.10), which are detailed in the folder *F:_Grazingecology_Pasture. In total 307 forage sample locations were identified for sampling. Metadata for the forage data is located in the *F:_Grazingecologydocs* folder. Labels for the bags were created using the “Forage Sample Labels.xlsx” workbook, which was sent to the Forage Lab at the Noble Research Institute. 307 locations were collected for Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) analysis. 50 sample locations were identified, an a separate sample was collected identical to the first sample, and sent to the lab for Wet Chemistry Analysis. The matching locations are detailed in the excel workbook “Forage_locMatched.xlsx”. Metadata for the NIR and Wet Chemistry results are located in the “NIRColumn Headings.xlsx” workbook, which describes the metric for each variable returned by the analysis. ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile ## Source: &quot;/Volumes/Extreme SSD/MSU_Grazingecology/RawData/MSU_Pasture/WGS84_UTM16/MSU_Pasture.shp&quot;, layer: &quot;MSU_Pasture&quot; ## with 1 features ## It has 1 fields ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile ## Source: &quot;/Volumes/Extreme SSD/MSU_Grazingecology/RawData/MSU_Pasture/Samplingpoints/NIRSshape/NIRSpoints.shp&quot;, layer: &quot;NIRSpoints&quot; ## with 307 features ## It has 10 fields Figure 2.10: Forage sampling locations for the MSU grazing ecology pasture. Navigation to sample locations was accomplished using a Garmin handheld device (Figure 2.11). This allowed us to navigate to each sample location (Figure 2.10), where we then through the 1/4m2 quadrate in a random direction over our shoulder, and cut the sample using hand shears (Figure 2.13). Following clipping of forage sample, it was placed in a brown bag (Figure 2.12), sealed, and prepared for shipment to the forage lab at the Noble Research Institute. Figure 2.11: Garmin handheld model 64s device used to navigate to sampling points in the trial Figure 2.12: Figure 2.13: The 1/4 meter2 quadrate, clippers, and forage sample bag after collection Notes are reported in the Garminwaypoints folder. Pasture statistics were calculated using the Rcode, MSUpasture.R. Results from the NIR data are located in the folder *F:_Grazingecology_results, and the Wet Chemistry results are in F:_Grazingecology_results. The Rcode files, ran in order from 1 - 3, create the NIRStacked.csv, WETstacked.csv, and the combined Forage.csv files.

This project was conducted during the calendar year of 2020, and experienced numerous issues and difficulties due primarily to the COVID 19 pandemic, which resulted in the missing of 2 field data collection trips the end of March and beginning of May, 2020. However, deployed data collection devices performed remarkedly well, and I consider this to be the better of the two field seasons. Please see an overall timeline of events below (Figure 3.2). Figure 3.2: The timeline laid out below shows the general sequence of events, both planned and unplanned, for the timeline of the field season at the Noble Research Institute. 3.1 Initial Files Files - Planning - Folder with initial collar files, Drone permission forms, Houseing forms, and initial pasture maps.

Files are saved in “F:_Grazingecology“. Cattle routinely destroyed the cameras, so while there may be interesting video available, it is doubtfull any complete videos exist to be analyzed. 3.3 Cattle Brahman (Bos taurus indicus) crossbred steers (n = 10) were grazed together continuously on pasture from February 21st, 2020, to December 3rd, 2020, which resulted in 286 days for the grazing trial. Cattle were sourced using the order buyer for the Noble Research Institute at the Oklahoma City Stockyards.

The number of accelerometer, and orientation of the accelerometer were etched into the exterior of the housing using a sautering iron. Figure 3.6: Example of the housing used to protect the DDMT device and attach it to the collar Housings were affixed to the strap of the Vectronic collar (Figure 3.7) initially using hose clamps. However, we experienced numerous failures and lost accelerometers (noted in the Accelerometer log workbook). We then used heavy duty zip ties which worked magnificently, and I highly recommend (Figure 3.7).

Forage samples will be collected on a regular spatial and temporal scale. Forage samples will be collected every 35 days, or 1 week out of every 5. Forage samples were collected on a 20 meter grid (Figure 3.10) and named according to their x and y location in the grid pattern. . Locations are loaded into a Garmin 54s handheld GPS unit. Upon arrival at the sampling location, a ¼ meter^2 quadrat will be randomly tossed over the shoulder, landing within approximately 5 ft of the sampling point. The grass within the quadrat will be clipped and stuffed into a brown paper forage sampling bag, which will be labeled with the sample name, number and unique barcode. Following collection of the forage samples, they will be transported to the Noble Research Institutes forage testing laboratory for analysis. Wet weight, Dry weight will be measured to calculate total dry matter, as well as standard NRI forage analysis following Noble protocols.

Flight operations will be conducted by a pilot holding an FAA remote pilot certificate. Spectral imaging will be collected in 5 bands; red, green, blue, near infrared (NIR), and red edge. Flights are expected to last approximately 30 minutes from take-off to landing. The final flight plan will include an intermediate landing for battery replacement. Flights will be conducted at 400 feet, and in accordance with safety guidelines set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Noble Research Institute. The camera collected reflectance in the green, blue, red, near-infrared, and red-edge spectral bands at 8.5 cm resolution from a flight altitude of 122 m above ground level with 80% overlap. After imagery was collected, individual pictures were mosaiced utilizing Pix 4D software (Pix 4D Inc. Prilly, Switzerland) and we calculated the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at each pixel following standard procedure (Huete et al. 2002)). Complete description can be found in the description given by (Parsons et al. 2022). Figure 3.14: The DJI Matrice 100 unmanned aerial vehicle and MicaSense MX multispectral camera used to map the study area The pilot will meet the following requirements: 1. Pilot will hold a valid remote pilot certificate from the FAA 2. Pilot will be trained in operating the aircraft stated above, with prior experience in conducting flight operations. 3. Only one aircraft will be operated at one time 4. The pilot in command will be in a physical, mental condition prepared to collected quality data in accordance with safety guidelines and the protocol for this study. 5. The aircraft will weight less than 55 lbs. in accordance with FAA and NIR regulations 6. The aircraft will not be operated above 400 ft above ground level. 7. A visual line of sight will be maintained with the aircraft at all times. 8. Prior to take-off aircraft will be visually inspected for flight worthiness. 9.

Theses and Dissertations. 1. https://scholarsjunction.msstate.edu/td/5650 Abstract: Ruminant animals comprise the greatest proportion of herbivores around the world, provide essential ecosystem services and human consumable protein by consuming grass and human inedible dietary fiber. Herbivory pressure alters plant communities and species diversity, effectively making grazing animals ecosystem engineers in dynamic ecosystems. Development of advanced computer processing power coupled with biometric and ecosystem sensors may be employed in the internet of things framework to create an integrated information system designed to inform understanding of grazing system function and animal energy balance. Towards this end, I utilized Bos indicus / Bos taurus crossbred steers (n = 20) across two study sites each in consecutive calendar years and fitted them with GPS and accelerometer collar systems. Steers were grazed in improved grass pastures containing Tall Fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and Bermudagrass (Cyanodon dactylon). Forage samples were collected in a 20-m grid pattern at 35-day intervals to test nutritional composition, and NDVI maps were created using remotely sensed data collected using a UAV mounted camera system. In the first chapter, I utilize the movement ecology framework to investigate metabolic theory and animal behavior on energy budgets, then explore available technology to utilize in an integrative information system. In Chapter 2, I tested preprocessing and behavior collection methods used to train a machine learning randomforest classification model to predict animal behavior using triaxial accelerometers. Landscape functional scale and optimal sampling density is the primary focus of Chapter 3, where I explored the complex relationship between sampling regime, interpolation strategy, and landscape complexity, demonstrating that sampling density is a product of desired accuracy and landscape complexity. Finally, I focused on animal growth in Chapter 4, demonstrating the functionality of a walk-over-weigh system, and identified robust regression as the most accurate smoothing method to identify and remove spurious animal weights. The following project files were created by Ira Parsons to complete his dissertation.

We evaluated these relationships using both simulated data of known and controllable landscape complexity, and in situ data collected on a grazing pasture by remote sensing using an unmanned aerial system. We also describe variation in interpolation accuracy with respect to raster resolution from remotely sensed data. Methods We simulated landscapes of variable heterogeneity, successively increasing sampling densities using both gridded and random sampling strategies. Next, we applied each of three local interpolation methods: Inverse Distance Weighting, Universal Kriging, and Nearest Neighbor — to the sampled data and estimated goodness-of-fit (R2) between resulting interpolated surfaces and the original landscape surface. Finally, we applied these analyses to a normalized difference vegetation index raster collected from pasture at multiple spatial scales by aggregating cells into coarser resolutions. Results During simulation, all interpolation methods and sampling strategies performed similarly, except for random sampling combined with universal kriging. The highest R2 values occurred with low landscape heterogeneity and high sampling density. For the normalized difference vegetation index data, Universal Kriging performed best with gridded sampling, and inverse distance weighting performed best with random sampling. For all methods, goodness-of-fit was highest at intermediate sampling densities. Heterogeneity decreased with resolution, which increased accuracy of all interpolation methods. Irrespective of the interpolation method, landscape heterogeneity had a greater effect on accuracy over sampling density. Conclusions Whereas landscape heterogeneity, sampling design, and interpolation method are important contributing factors, we show that landscape heterogeneity can have the largest impact on the accuracy of predicted maps. From here, there is a need to create structured tools to aid in determining sampling design most appropriate for interpolation methods across landscapes of various heterogeneity. 4.4 Chapter 4 - Walk over Weigh Figure 4.5: Files from the walk-over-weight analysis used to identify the appropriate means to remove obviously spurious data points from the raw data files - asas_2022 - Abstract written and submitted to the National Animal Science Meetings held in Oklahma City, OK, 2022 - CEA submission - The first copy submitted to computers and electronics in Agriculture - Data - Raw data copied from the RawData file.

However, traditional methods of collecting body weight are stressful, costly, and logistically impractical with cattle on extensive landscapes. Remote systems capable of collecting individual animal body weight provide a potential solution, but automatic systems may collect spurious measurements. The objectives of this study were to 1) describe the utility of using a remote weight capture system, 2) develop methods for identifying and removing spurious measurements, and 3) cross-validate automatically collected weights with static chute collected weights. Beef steers (n = 10) were tagged with electronic Radio Frequency Identification tags in an improved pasture (± 11.54 hectares) containing Bermuda (Cynodon dactylon) and Tall Fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and inter-seeded with Annual Ryegrass (Secale cereale). A walk-over-weigh (WOW) system was designed from a platform scale connected to a TruTest® scale head and paired with a computer to save data files. In total, 5,466 raw weights associated with individuals were collected (0 kg &lt; weight &lt; 1,000 kg). We assessed the use of whole herd and individual means ± 1 standard deviation calculated either daily or over the entire trial to identify potential outliers. Additionally, 3 data smoothing methods were tested: a linear quadratic model, cubic splines, and polynomial regression. Each method was evaluated for total weight events recorded, event frequency, measured body mass and average daily gain. Further, accuracy and precision was calculated using cross-validation with paired chute weights (n = 8). Whole herd means ± 1 SD identified the fewest spurious data points and showed a stronger relationship with paired chute weights (R2 = 0.90) whereas individual daily means ± 1 SD identified the most and exhibited a weaker relationship (R2 = 0.68). Repeated quadratic regression models provided the best results, identifying 3,759 clean weight points and providing an R2 = 0.96 between paired chute and WOW measurements. A real-time simulation analysis found that both individual and the herd means ± 1 SD performed similarly with an average of 30% of data classified as spurious and removed from the analysis, resulting in agreement (R2 = 0.93 for both individual and herd means) between chute and WOW weight measurements. These results indicate the utility of using a simple WOW system to collect data for measuring individual animal body mass and associated metrics, which has implications on making management and marketing decisions in near real-time. 4.5 Professional Presentations Ira L.
